What is JavaScript:
====================
JavaScript is an Interpreted, dynamic programming language.

Primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.

It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS.

No need for compilation; executed directly by the browser.

Event-Driven & Asynchronous: Handles user interactions and asynchronous 
tasks efficiently.

Cross-Platform: Works on all major browsers and platforms.

Manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to update content dynamically.

Build Single Page Applications (SPAs) with frameworks like React, Angular, 
Vue.

We can develop the backend applications by using Node JS.

Every modern browser supports JavaScript.

Versatile: Works for front-end, back-end, mobile apps, and 
even desktop apps.
